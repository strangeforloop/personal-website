This year I attended my the Society of Women Engineer's (SWE) National Conference from November 7 - 9 in Anaheim, California. I learned many lessons from that experience that I thought I'd share.

## If you're thinking about going and want tips, I hope this blog post will help.

###1. Do your research on how to be prepared for the specific conference because every conference is different.
For the Society of Women Engineer's Conference this means registering on the [conference website](https://we19.swe.org/) well in advanced in order to get the best-valued conference tickets. In addition to this, upload your resume to the general [SWE website](https://swe.org/) at least a couple weeks prior to the conference. Many companies are looking to do on-site interviews during the conference and will scout candidates from resumes uploaded here. You never know what can happen!
###2. Being personable is extremely important.
###3. You're presented with an amazing inside look at many companies.
Ask genuine questions because it's rare to get the chance to talk to actual people about their day to day job.
There are hundreds if not thousands of people talking to recruiters. Having a pre-rehearsed and unmemorable introduction is not 
It's a great opportunity to step back and be really curious about what other people care about and how they got there. You can learn a lot about other people's experiences and pathways.
###4. You have the opportunity to have several technical interviews.
    1. Sometimes you will be asked technical questions right at the booth. Or, if a company is interested in you from your resume (see tip #1), then you may have a formal technical. The opportunity for practice is incredibly valuable.
###5. Have an easily scannable resume
    1. Recruiters are very unlikely to read your resume word-for word. It was found that when most people scan, they read in an "F-shaped" pattern. This is where having clearly defined sections and bullet points is crucial. Also, have a standard and clean looking resume. I'm not saying don't add some personal pizzazz, but you don't want your recruiter to struggle to find information or for your resume to stand out in a bad way.
